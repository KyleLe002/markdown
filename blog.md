# Hello Everyone

## About Me

This is a quick blog post for me to practice using markdown. Prior to this post I have **NEVER** used markdown!!!

I'm learning how to code because I love challenging myself to learn new things, and I find it very fun to be able to create things!

## Facts
---------

* I like to strength train regularly.
* I eventually want to have a career in the IT/Cyber field.

### Goodbye!
_That's_ all I have to say for now! **_Ciao!_**
